    Parameters
    ----------
    reliability_data : ndarray, with shape (M, N)
        Reliability data matrix which has the rate the i coder gave to the j unit, where M is the number of raters
        and N is the unit count.
        Missing rates are represented with `np.nan`.

    value_domain : array_like, with shape (V,)
        Possible values the units can take.

    Returns
    -------
    value_counts : ndarray, with shape (N, V)
        Number of coders that assigned a certain value to a determined unit, where N is the number of units
        and V is the value count.
