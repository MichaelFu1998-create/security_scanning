def Parachor(MW, rhol, rhog, sigma):
    r'''Calculate Parachor for a pure species, using its density in the
    liquid and gas phases, surface tension, and molecular weight.

    .. math::
        P = \frac{\sigma^{0.25} MW}{\rho_L - \rho_V}
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    MW : float
        Molecular weight, [g/mol]
    rhol : float
        Liquid density [kg/m^3]
    rhog : float
        Gas density [kg/m^3]
    sigma : float
        Surface tension, [N/m]

    Returns
    -------
    P : float
        Parachor, [N^0.25*m^2.75/mol]

    Notes
    -----
    To convert the output of this function to units of [mN^0.25*m^2.75/kmol], 
    multiply by 5623.4132519.
    
    Values in group contribution tables for Parachor are often listed as 
    dimensionless, in which they are multiplied by 5623413 and the appropriate
    units to make them dimensionless.
    
    Examples
    --------
    Calculating Parachor from a known surface tension for methyl isobutyl 
    ketone at 293.15 K
    
    >>> Parachor(100.15888, 800.8088185536124, 4.97865317223119, 0.02672166960656005)
    5.088443542210164e-05
    
    Converting to the `dimensionless` form:
    
    >>> 5623413*5.088443542210164e-05
    286.14419565030687
    
    Compared to 274.9 according to a group contribution method described in
    [3]_.
