def _proc_iteroutput_thread(proc):
    """
    Iterates over output from a process line by line

    Note:
        WARNING. Current implementation might have bugs with other threads.
        This behavior was seen when using earlier versions of tqdm. I'm not
        sure if this was our bug or tqdm's. Newer versions of tqdm fix this,
        but I cannot guarantee that there isn't an issue on our end.

    Yields:
        Tuple[str, str]: oline, eline: stdout and stderr line
