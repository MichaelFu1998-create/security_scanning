        Read header lines up to the entirely blank line that terminates them.
        The (normally blank) line that ends the headers is skipped, but not
        included in the returned list.  If a non-header line ends the headers,
        (which is an error), an attempt is made to backspace over it; it is
        never included in the returned list.

        The variable self.status is set to the empty string if all went well,
        otherwise it is an error message.  The variable self.headers is a
        completely uninterpreted list of lines contained in the header (so
        printing them will reproduce the header exactly as it appears in the
        file).
