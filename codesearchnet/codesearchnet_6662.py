def K_value(P=None, Psat=None, phi_l=None, phi_g=None, gamma=None, Poynting=1):
    r'''Calculates the equilibrium K-value assuming Raoult's law,
    or an equation of state model, or an activity coefficient model,
    or a combined equation of state-activity model.

    The calculation procedure will use the most advanced approach with the
    provided inputs:

        * If `P`, `Psat`, `phi_l`, `phi_g`, and `gamma` are provided, use the
          combined approach.
        * If `P`, `Psat`, and `gamma` are provided, use the modified Raoult's
          law.
        * If `phi_l` and `phi_g` are provided, use the EOS only method.
        * If `P` and `Psat` are provided, use Raoult's law.

    Definitions:

    .. math::
        K_i=\frac{y_i}{x_i}

    Raoult's law:

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{P_{i}^{sat}}{P}

    Activity coefficient, no EOS (modified Raoult's law):

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\gamma_i P_{i}^{sat}}{P}

    Equation of state only:

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\phi_i^l}{\phi_i^v} = \frac{f_i^l}{f_i^v}

    Combined approach (liquid reference fugacity coefficient is normally
    calculated the saturation pressure for it as a pure species; vapor fugacity
    coefficient calculated normally):

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\gamma_i P_i^{sat} \phi_i^{l,ref}}{\phi_i^v P}

    Combined approach, with Poynting Correction Factor (liquid molar volume in
    the integral is for i as a pure species only):

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\gamma_i P_i^{sat} \phi_i^{l, ref} \exp\left[\frac{
        \int_{P_i^{sat}}^P V_i^l dP}{RT}\right]}{\phi_i^v P}

    Parameters
    ----------
    P : float
        System pressure, optional
    Psat : float
        Vapor pressure of species i, [Pa]
    phi_l : float
        Fugacity coefficient of species i in the liquid phase, either
        at the system conditions (EOS-only case) or at the saturation pressure
        of species i as a pure species (reference condition for the combined
        approach), optional [-]
    phi_g : float
        Fugacity coefficient of species i in the vapor phase at the system
        conditions, optional [-]
    gamma : float
        Activity coefficient of species i in the liquid phase, optional [-]
    Poynting : float
        Poynting correction factor, optional [-]

    Returns
    -------
    K : float
        Equilibrium K value of component i, calculated with an approach
        depending on the provided inputs [-]

    Notes
    -----
    The Poynting correction factor is normally simplified as follows, due to
    a liquid's low pressure dependency:

    .. math::
        K_i = \frac{\gamma_i P_i^{sat} \phi_i^{l, ref} \exp\left[\frac{V_l
        (P-P_i^{sat})}{RT}\right]}{\phi_i^v P}

    Examples
    --------
    Raoult's law:

    >>> K_value(101325, 3000.)
    0.029607698001480384

    Modified Raoult's law:

    >>> K_value(P=101325, Psat=3000, gamma=0.9)
    0.026646928201332347

    EOS-only approach:

    >>> K_value(phi_l=1.6356, phi_g=0.88427)
    1.8496613025433408

    Gamma-phi combined approach:

    >>> K_value(P=1E6, Psat=1938800, phi_l=1.4356, phi_g=0.88427, gamma=0.92)
    2.8958055544121137

    Gamma-phi combined approach with a Poynting factor:

    >>> K_value(P=1E6, Psat=1938800, phi_l=1.4356, phi_g=0.88427, gamma=0.92,
    ... Poynting=0.999)
