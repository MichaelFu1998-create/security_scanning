        Each triple is of the form (i, j, n), and means that
        a[i:i+n] == b[j:j+n].  The triples are monotonically increasing in
        i and in j.  New in Python 2.5, it's also guaranteed that if
        (i, j, n) and (i', j', n') are adjacent triples in the list, and
        the second is not the last triple in the list, then i+n != i' or
        j+n != j'.  IOW, adjacent triples never describe adjacent equal
        blocks.

        The last triple is a dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and is the only
        triple with n==0.
