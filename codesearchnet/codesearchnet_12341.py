    '''This gets a FITS cutout from the NASA GSFC SkyView service.

    This downloads stamps in FITS format from the NASA SkyView service:

    https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl


    Parameters
    ----------

    ra,decl : float
        These are decimal equatorial coordinates for the cutout center.

    survey : str
        The survey name to get the stamp from. This is one of the
        values in the 'SkyView Surveys' option boxes on the SkyView
        webpage. Currently, we've only tested using 'DSS2 Red' as the value for
        this kwarg, but the other ones should work in principle.

    scaling : str
        This is the pixel value scaling function to use.

    sizepix : int
        The width and height of the cutout are specified by this value.

    forcefetch : bool
        If True, will disregard any existing cached copies of the stamp already
        downloaded corresponding to the requested center coordinates and
        redownload the FITS from the SkyView service.

    cachedir : str
        This is the path to the astrobase cache directory. All downloaded FITS
        stamps are stored here as .fits.gz files so we can immediately respond
        with the cached copy when a request is made for a coordinate center
        that's already been downloaded.

    timeout : float
        Sets the timeout in seconds to wait for a response from the NASA SkyView
        service.

    retry_failed : bool
        If the initial request to SkyView fails, and this is True, will retry
        until it succeeds.

    verbose : bool
        If True, indicates progress.

    jitter : float
        This is used to control the scale of the random wait in seconds before
        starting the query. Useful in parallelized situations.
