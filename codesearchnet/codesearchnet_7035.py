def calculate_integral_over_T(self, T1, T2, method):
        r'''Method to calculate the integral of a property over temperature
        with respect to temperature, using a specified method. Uses SciPy's 
        `quad` function to perform the integral, with no options.
        
        This method can be overwritten by subclasses who may perfer to add
        analytical methods for some or all methods as this is much faster.

        If the calculation does not succeed, returns the actual error
        encountered.

        Parameters
        ----------
        T1 : float
            Lower limit of integration, [K]
        T2 : float
            Upper limit of integration, [K]
        method : str
            Method for which to find the integral

        Returns
        -------
        integral : float
            Calculated integral of the property over the given range, 
            [`units`]
        '''
        return float(quad(lambda T: self.calculate(T, method)/T, T1, T2)[0])
