        """Create multiple cells from an Excel range.

        This method reads values from a range in an Excel file,
        create cells and populate them with the values in the range.
        To use this method, ``openpyxl`` package must be installed.

        The Excel file to read data from is specified by ``book``
        parameters. The ``range_`` can be a range address, such as "$G4:$K10",
        or a named range. In case a range address is given,
        ``sheet`` must also be given.

        By default, cells data are interpreted as being laid out side-by-side.
        ``names_row`` is a row index (starting from 0) to specify the
        row that contains the names of cells and parameters.
        Cells and parameter names must be contained in a single row.
        ``param_cols`` accepts a sequence (such as list or tuple) of
        column indexes (starting from 0) that indicate columns that
        contain cells arguments.

        **2-dimensional cells definitions**

        The optional ``names_col`` and ``param_rows`` parameters are used,
        when data for one cells spans more than one column.
        In such cases, the cells data is 2-dimensional, and
        there must be parameter row(s) across the columns
        that contain arguments of the parameters.
        A sequence of row indexes that indicate parameter rows
        is passed to ``param_rows``.
        The names of those parameters must be contained in the
        same rows as parameter values (arguments), and
        ``names_col`` is to indicate the column position at which
        the parameter names are defined.

        **Horizontal arrangement**

        By default, cells data are interpreted as being placed
        side-by-side, regardless of whether one cells corresponds
        to a single column or multiple columns.
        ``transpose`` parameter is used to alter this orientation,
        and if it is set to ``True``, cells values are
        interpreted as being placed one above the other.
        "row(s)" and "col(s)" in the parameter
        names are interpreted inversely, i.e.
        all indexes passed to "row(s)" parameters are interpreted
        as column indexes,
        and all indexes passed to "col(s)" parameters as row indexes.


        Args:
            book (str): Path to an Excel file.
            range_ (str): Range expression, such as "A1", "$G4:$K10",
                or named range "NamedRange1".
            sheet (str): Sheet name (case ignored).
            names_row (optional): an index number indicating
                what row contains the names of cells and parameters.
                Defaults to the top row (0).
            param_cols (optional): a sequence of index numbers
                indicating parameter columns.
                Defaults to only the leftmost column ([0]).
            names_col (optional): an index number, starting from 0,
                indicating what column contains additional parameters.
            param_rows (optional): a sequence of index numbers, starting from
                0, indicating rows of additional parameters, in case cells are
                defined in two dimensions.
            transpose (optional): Defaults to ``False``.
                If set to ``True``, "row(s)" and "col(s)" in the parameter
                names are interpreted inversely, i.e.
                all indexes passed to "row(s)" parameters are interpreted
                as column indexes,
                and all indexes passed to "col(s)" parameters as row indexes.
            param_order (optional): a sequence to reorder the parameters.
                The elements of the sequence are the indexes of ``param_cols``
                elements, and optionally the index of ``param_rows`` elements
                shifted by the length of ``param_cols``.
