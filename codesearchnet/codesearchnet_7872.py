def tempo(self, factor, audio_type=None, quick=False):
        '''Time stretch audio without changing pitch.

        This effect uses the WSOLA algorithm. The audio is chopped up into
        segments which are then shifted in the time domain and overlapped
        (cross-faded) at points where their waveforms are most similar as
        determined by measurement of least squares.

        Parameters
        ----------
        factor : float
            The ratio of new tempo to the old tempo.
            For ex. 1.1 speeds up the tempo by 10%; 0.9 slows it down by 10%.
        audio_type : str
            Type of audio, which optimizes algorithm parameters. One of:
             * m : Music,
             * s : Speech,
             * l : Linear (useful when factor is close to 1),
        quick : bool, default=False
            If True, this effect will run faster but with lower sound quality.
