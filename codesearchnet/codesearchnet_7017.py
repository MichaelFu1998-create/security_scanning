def Vfs_to_zs(Vfs, Vms):
    r'''Converts a list of mass fractions to mole fractions. Requires molecular
    weights for all species.

    .. math::
        z_i = \frac{\frac{\text{Vf}_i}{V_{m,i}}}{\sum_i
        \frac{\text{Vf}_i}{V_{m,i}}}

    Parameters
    ----------
    Vfs : iterable
        Molar volume fractions [-]
    VMs : iterable
        Molar volumes of species [m^3/mol]

    Returns
    -------
    zs : list
        Mole fractions [-]

    Notes
    -----
    Does not check that the sums add to one. Does not check that inputs are of
    the same length.

    Molar volumes are specified in terms of pure components only. Function
    works with any phase.

    Examples
    --------
    Acetone and benzene example
