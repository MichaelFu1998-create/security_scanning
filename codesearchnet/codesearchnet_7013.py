def Z_from_virial_pressure_form(P, *args):
    r'''Calculates the compressibility factor of a gas given its pressure, and 
    pressure-form virial coefficients. Any number of coefficients is supported.

    .. math::
        Z = \frac{Pv}{RT} = 1 + B'P + C'P^2 + D'P^3 + E'P^4 \dots

    Parameters
    ----------
    P : float
        Pressure, [Pa]
    B to Z : float, optional
        Pressure form Virial coefficients, [various]

    Returns
    -------
    Z : float
        Compressibility factor at P, and with given virial coefficients, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    Note that although this function does not require a temperature input, it  
    is still dependent on it because the coefficients themselves normally are
    regressed in terms of temperature.
    
    The use of this form is less common than the density form. Its coefficients
    are normally indicated with the "'" suffix.
    
    If no virial coefficients are given, returns 1, as per the ideal gas law.
    
    The units of each virial coefficient are as follows, where for B, n=1, and
    C, n=2, and so on.
    
    .. math::
        \left(\frac{1}{\text{Pa}}\right)^n
