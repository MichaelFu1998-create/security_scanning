def _smooth_array(arr, affine, fwhm=None, ensure_finite=True, copy=True, **kwargs):
    """Smooth images by applying a Gaussian filter.
    Apply a Gaussian filter along the three first dimensions of arr.

    This is copied and slightly modified from nilearn:
    https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/image/image.py
    Added the **kwargs argument.

    Parameters
    ==========
    arr: numpy.ndarray
        4D array, with image number as last dimension. 3D arrays are also
        accepted.
    affine: numpy.ndarray
        (4, 4) matrix, giving affine transformation for image. (3, 3) matrices
        are also accepted (only these coefficients are used).
        If fwhm='fast', the affine is not used and can be None
    fwhm: scalar, numpy.ndarray, 'fast' or None
        Smoothing strength, as a full-width at half maximum, in millimeters.
        If a scalar is given, width is identical on all three directions.
        A numpy.ndarray must have 3 elements, giving the FWHM along each axis.
        If fwhm == 'fast', a fast smoothing will be performed with
        a filter [0.2, 1, 0.2] in each direction and a normalisation
        to preserve the local average value.
        If fwhm is None, no filtering is performed (useful when just removal
        of non-finite values is needed).
    ensure_finite: bool
        if True, replace every non-finite values (like NaNs) by zero before
        filtering.
    copy: bool
        if True, input array is not modified. False by default: the filtering
        is performed in-place.
    kwargs: keyword-arguments
        Arguments for the ndimage.gaussian_filter1d function.

    Returns
    =======
    filtered_arr: numpy.ndarray
        arr, filtered.
    Notes
    =====
    This function is most efficient with arr in C order.
