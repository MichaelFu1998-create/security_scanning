        compared to ReplayBuffer.sample
        it also returns importance weights and idxes
        of sampled experiences.


        Parameters
        ----------
        batch_size: int
            How many transitions to sample.
        beta: float
            To what degree to use importance weights
            (0 - no corrections, 1 - full correction)

        Returns
        -------
        obs_batch: np.array
            batch of observations
        act_batch: np.array
            batch of actions executed given obs_batch
        rew_batch: np.array
            rewards received as results of executing act_batch
        next_obs_batch: np.array
            next set of observations seen after executing act_batch
        done_mask: np.array
            done_mask[i] = 1 if executing act_batch[i] resulted in
            the end of an episode and 0 otherwise.
        weights: np.array
            Array of shape (batch_size,) and dtype np.float32
            denoting importance weight of each sampled transition
        idxes: np.array
            Array of shape (batch_size,) and dtype np.int32
            idexes in buffer of sampled experiences
