        flux of every pixel multiplied by the regularization coefficient.
    log_curvature_regularization_term : float
        The log of the determinant of the sum of the curvature and regularization matrices.
    log_regularization_term : float
        The log of the determinant o the regularization matrix.
    noise_normalization : float
        The normalization noise_map-term for the observed datas's noise-map.
