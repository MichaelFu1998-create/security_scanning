    """Perform basic pFBA (parsimonious Enzyme Usage Flux Balance Analysis)
    to minimize total flux.

    pFBA [1] adds the minimization of all fluxes the the objective of the
    model. This approach is motivated by the idea that high fluxes have a
    higher enzyme turn-over and that since producing enzymes is costly,
    the cell will try to minimize overall flux while still maximizing the
    original objective function, e.g. the growth rate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The model
    fraction_of_optimum : float, optional
        Fraction of optimum which must be maintained. The original objective
        reaction is constrained to be greater than maximal_value *
        fraction_of_optimum.
    objective : dict or model.problem.Objective
        A desired objective to use during optimization in addition to the
        pFBA objective. Dictionaries (reaction as key, coefficient as value)
        can be used for linear objectives.
    reactions : iterable
        List of reactions or reaction identifiers. Implies `return_frame` to
        be true. Only return fluxes for the given reactions. Faster than
        fetching all fluxes if only a few are needed.

    Returns
    -------
    cobra.Solution
        The solution object to the optimized model with pFBA constraints added.
