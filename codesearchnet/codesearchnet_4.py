def lstm(nlstm=128, layer_norm=False):
    """
    Builds LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) network to be used in a policy.
    Note that the resulting function returns not only the output of the LSTM
    (i.e. hidden state of lstm for each step in the sequence), but also a dictionary
    with auxiliary tensors to be set as policy attributes.

    Specifically,
        S is a placeholder to feed current state (LSTM state has to be managed outside policy)
        M is a placeholder for the mask (used to mask out observations after the end of the episode, but can be used for other purposes too)
        initial_state is a numpy array containing initial lstm state (usually zeros)
        state is the output LSTM state (to be fed into S at the next call)


    An example of usage of lstm-based policy can be found here: common/tests/test_doc_examples.py/test_lstm_example

    Parameters:
    ----------

    nlstm: int          LSTM hidden state size

    layer_norm: bool    if True, layer-normalized version of LSTM is used

    Returns:
    -------

    function that builds LSTM with a given input tensor / placeholder
