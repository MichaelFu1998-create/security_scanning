    This will almost always be called from a python script in
    the following manner:

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            yaz.main()

    This function will perform the following steps:

    1. It will load any additional python code from
       the yaz_extension python module located in the
       ~/.yaz directory when LOAD_YAZ_EXTENSION is True
       and the yaz_extension module exists

    2. It collects all yaz tasks and plugins.  When WHITE_LIST
       is a non-empty list, only the tasks and plugins located
       therein will be considered

    3. It will parse arguments from ARGV, or the command line
       when ARGV is not given, resulting in a yaz task or a parser
       help message.

    4. When a suitable task is found, this task is executed.  In
       case of a task which is part of a plugin, i.e. class, then
       this plugin is initialized, possibly resulting in other
       plugins to also be initialized if there are marked as
       `@yaz.dependency`.
