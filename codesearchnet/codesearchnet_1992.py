def acquire(self, blocking=1):
        """Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.

        When invoked without arguments: if this thread already owns the lock,
        increment the recursion level by one, and return immediately. Otherwise,
        if another thread owns the lock, block until the lock is unlocked. Once
        the lock is unlocked (not owned by any thread), then grab ownership, set
        the recursion level to one, and return. If more than one thread is
        blocked waiting until the lock is unlocked, only one at a time will be
        able to grab ownership of the lock. There is no return value in this
        case.

        When invoked with the blocking argument set to true, do the same thing
        as when called without arguments, and return true.

        When invoked with the blocking argument set to false, do not block. If a
        call without an argument would block, return false immediately;
        otherwise, do the same thing as when called without arguments, and
        return true.
