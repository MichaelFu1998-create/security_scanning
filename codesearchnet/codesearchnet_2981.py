def _GetTextInside(text, start_pattern):
  r"""Retrieves all the text between matching open and close parentheses.

  Given a string of lines and a regular expression string, retrieve all the text
  following the expression and between opening punctuation symbols like
  (, [, or {, and the matching close-punctuation symbol. This properly nested
  occurrences of the punctuations, so for the text like
    printf(a(), b(c()));
  a call to _GetTextInside(text, r'printf\(') will return 'a(), b(c())'.
  start_pattern must match string having an open punctuation symbol at the end.

  Args:
    text: The lines to extract text. Its comments and strings must be elided.
           It can be single line and can span multiple lines.
    start_pattern: The regexp string indicating where to start extracting
                   the text.
  Returns:
    The extracted text.
    None if either the opening string or ending punctuation could not be found.
