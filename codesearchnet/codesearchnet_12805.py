def loci2migrate(name, locifile, popdict, mindict=1):
    """  
    A function to build an input file for the program migrate from an ipyrad 
    .loci file, and a dictionary grouping Samples into populations. 

    Parameters:
    -----------
    name: (str)
       The name prefix for the migrate formatted output file.
    locifile: (str)
       The path to the .loci file produced by ipyrad. 
    popdict: (dict)
       A Python dictionary grouping Samples into Populations. 
    
    Examples:
    ---------
    You can create the population dictionary by hand, and pass in the path 
    to your .loci file as a string. 
       >> popdict = {'A': ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'B': ['d', 'e', 'f']}
       >> loci2migrate("outfile.migrate", "./mydata.loci", popdict)

    Or, if you load your ipyrad.Assembly object from it's JSON file, you can
    access the loci file path and population information from there directly. 
       >> data = ip.load_json("mydata.json")
       >> loci2migrate("outfile.migrate", data.outfiles.loci, data.populations)
