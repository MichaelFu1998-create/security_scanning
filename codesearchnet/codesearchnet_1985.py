        Note that we don't define __hash__: not all sets are hashable.
        But if you define a hashable set type, its __hash__ should
        call this function.

        This must be compatible __eq__.

        All sets ought to compare equal if they contain the same
        elements, regardless of how they are implemented, and
        regardless of the order of the elements; so there's not much
        freedom for __eq__ or __hash__.  We match the algorithm used
        by the built-in frozenset type.
