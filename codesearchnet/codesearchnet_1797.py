    # repeats exactly every 400 years.  The basic strategy is to find the
    # closest 400-year boundary at or before n, then work with the offset
    # from that boundary to n.  Life is much clearer if we subtract 1 from
    # n first -- then the values of n at 400-year boundaries are exactly
    # those divisible by _DI400Y:
