def CloseExpression(clean_lines, linenum, pos):
  """If input points to ( or { or [ or <, finds the position that closes it.

  If lines[linenum][pos] points to a '(' or '{' or '[' or '<', finds the
  linenum/pos that correspond to the closing of the expression.

  TODO(unknown): cpplint spends a fair bit of time matching parentheses.
  Ideally we would want to index all opening and closing parentheses once
  and have CloseExpression be just a simple lookup, but due to preprocessor
  tricks, this is not so easy.

  Args:
    clean_lines: A CleansedLines instance containing the file.
    linenum: The number of the line to check.
    pos: A position on the line.

  Returns:
    A tuple (line, linenum, pos) pointer *past* the closing brace, or
    (line, len(lines), -1) if we never find a close.  Note we ignore
    strings and comments when matching; and the line we return is the
    'cleansed' line at linenum.
