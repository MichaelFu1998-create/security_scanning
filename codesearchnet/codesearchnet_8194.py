        :param list frames: a list of filenames, each of which represents a single
            frame of the animation.  Each frame must have exactly the same
            dimensions, and the code has only been tested with .gif files.

        :param float fps:
            The number of frames per second.

            The number of iterations. Default 0 (meaning loop indefinitely).

            The number of colors to quantize the image to. Is rounded to
            the nearest power of two. Default 256.
