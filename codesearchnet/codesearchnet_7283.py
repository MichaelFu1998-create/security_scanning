        the ADC value is within the high_threshold & low_threshold value (both
        should be signed 16-bit integers) and trigger the ALERT pin.  The
        behavior can be controlled by the following parameters:
          - active_low: Boolean that indicates if ALERT is pulled low or high
                        when active/triggered.  Default is true, active low.
          - traditional: Boolean that indicates if the comparator is in traditional
                         mode where it fires when the value is within the threshold,
                         or in window mode where it fires when the value is _outside_
                         the threshold range.  Default is true, traditional mode.
          - latching: Boolean that indicates if the alert should be held until
                      get_last_result() is called to read the value and clear
                      the alert.  Default is false, non-latching.
          - num_readings: The number of readings that match the comparator before
                          triggering the alert.  Can be 1, 2, or 4.  Default is 1.
        Will return an initial conversion result, then call the get_last_result()
        function continuously to read the most recent conversion result.  Call
        stop_adc() to stop conversions.
