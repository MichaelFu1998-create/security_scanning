        returns the list of output Expressions obtained by adding the given inputs
        to the current state, one by one, to both the forward and backward RNNs,

        .transduce(xs) is different from .add_inputs(xs) in the following way:

            .add_inputs(xs) returns a list of RNNState pairs. RNNState objects can be
             queried in various ways. In particular, they allow access to the previous
             state, as well as to the state-vectors (h() and s() )

            .transduce(xs) returns a list of Expression. These are just the output
             expressions. For many cases, this suffices. 
             transduce is much more memory efficient than add_inputs.
