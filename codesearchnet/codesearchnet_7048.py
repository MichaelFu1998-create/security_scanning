def calculate_derivative_P(self, P, T, method, order=1):
        r'''Method to calculate a derivative of a temperature and pressure
        dependent property with respect to pressure at constant temperature,
        of a given order using a specified method. Uses SciPy's derivative 
        function, with a delta of 0.01 Pa and a number of points equal to 
        2*order + 1.

        This method can be overwritten by subclasses who may perfer to add
        analytical methods for some or all methods as this is much faster.

        If the calculation does not succeed, returns the actual error
        encountered.

        Parameters
        ----------
        P : float
            Pressure at which to calculate the derivative, [Pa]
        T : float
            Temperature at which to calculate the derivative, [K]
        method : str
            Method for which to find the derivative
        order : int
            Order of the derivative, >= 1

        Returns
        -------
        d_prop_d_P_at_T : float
            Calculated derivative property at constant temperature, 
            [`units/Pa^order`]
        '''
        f = lambda P: self.calculate_P(T, P, method)
        return derivative(f, P, dx=1e-2, n=order, order=1+order*2)
